## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

Link to [Notion documents](https://lydian-emmental-e07.notion.site/F1-Fantasy-League-003e34c960324cd5bd7eee69d59e9130). This document has some of the info about the models, and some of the features as I am working on them.

This application makes use of :
1. [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x)
   1. [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail)
   2. [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum)
2. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
   1. [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/)
   2. [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/installation.html)
3. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)


## Contributing
If you would wish to contribute, feel free to create a PR! A couple of things we expect :
1. If you wrote a new feature, please write a test for that feature. 
2. Make sure your feature doesn't break any of the existing features by running `sail artisan test`.
3. If your PR interacts with a model, make sure to update the Factories so the tests pass.

## Code of Conduct

1. README only PRs will be declined.
2. PRs without tests will also be declined.
